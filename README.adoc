Working on Security ACLs with Spring Data query augmentation

= Known Issues

* Allow EntityManager from JpaCriteriaQueryContext for determining the id and if it is compound id or not
* Be nice if JpaUpdateContext and JpaCriteriaQueryContext were
** Symmetrical For example, JpaUpdateContext has EntityManager exposed, but does not have Root, CriteriaBuilder, or CriteriaQuery exposed.
And as mentioned above, JpaCriteriaQueryContext does not expose EntityManager.
** Shared a common parent (class or interface), so that I can modify the query with the same method easily
* See Tests for additional issues (all should pass)
